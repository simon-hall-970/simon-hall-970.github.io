       <p><strong>Technical blog - sprint 2</strong><br>Sunday 16 February 2020<br><em>by Simon Hall<em></em><p>
           <p><br>The margin, border, and padding properties determine the space between elements in the natural flow of the page as well as the placement of content within an element.</p>
           <p>This post looks at these properties of an element and the affect they have on the style of a web page.

           <div class="col-1">
               <h2>Margin</h2>
               <p>Margin is a property of an element that determines its outside space.  It sets a cushion of space between the elements boundary and other elements outside of it.</p>
               <p>One way to think of a margin is to think of a house as an element.  The property around the house would be the margin. If someone wanted to come and build a new house, they would have to do it outside your property lines.</p>
               
               <p>Similarly, when you set the margin of an element then you are defining a space between that element and other elements outside it.</p>

       <section class="sect-Bord">
            <div class="col-1">
            <h2>Border</h2>
               <p>The border is quite simply the boundary of an element. It defines the edges of the element itself.</p>

               <p>Let's look back at our house analogy. If the house were an element, then the border would the house's outside walls and cladding.</p>
               <div class="values">
                   <h3>Properties and values</h3>
                   <p>The border properties allow control over the width, color, and style of the border.</p>
               </div>
            </div>

            <div class="col-2"></div>
        </section>
        
        <section class="sect-Pad">
            <div class="col-1">
                <h2>Padding</h2>
                <p>The padding is the property that sets the space between the border and any content (including other elements) that live inside it.</p>

                <p>To understand padding think of an elevator. The elevator is the element. When one person hops inside an elevator it's not likely they will stand hard up against the wall of the elevator. Most likely they will stand somewhere near the middle.<p>

                </p>This space betwen them and the elevator walls could be considered the elevator's padding. If at the next floor 12 more people got into the elevator then the padding would be reduced as the content of the elevator would now be squashed right up agains the walls.</p>
