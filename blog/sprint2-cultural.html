        <h1>Learning Journey</h1>

        <h3>Career goals</h3>
        
        <p>My career goals are to graduate the course at DevAcademy. Find employment as a web developer within a month of graduating and start building cool things!</p>
        <p>I expect to get a junior web development role and to continue learning constantly. I would like to widen my skills by learning some other coding languages.  Within three to five years I aim to be in a lead development role with some contract work on the side.  In seven to ten years I would like to be a sought after expert in my field.</p>
        
        <h3>What human skills would you like to develop at EDA?</h3>
        <p>I have a tendency to underscope what I can get done.  It's odd because I was quite good at scoping work for others and could see when they were underscoping. I find it harder when it's me. I'd like to get better at evaluating what I can get done in how much time. At focusing on getting a minimum viable product out the door and then adding the flair once that part is done.</p>
        
        <h3>Struggles and successes</h3>
        <p>I've already run into issues with week two challenges. I tried to achieve too much in too short a span of time and got too focused on a single deliverable.</p>
        <p>Motivation is not the issue I'm enthusiastic, and I'm motivated. I haven't had any procrastination.  I've set myself enough time to work and get straight into it. I enjoy it.</p>
        <p>Where I'm falling short is in the attempt to do too much. This comes from a desire to be proud of what I built and wanting to challenge myself. Unfortunately sometimes when you do this you fail, but you always learn.</p>
        <h3>Workload management</h3>
        <p>To manage my workload I plan to do two things. Reading through all the weeks sprint on the first day. I'll listing all the deliverables for that sprint and map out the timeboxes for when I'll be doing what. I'll then track my progress against each deliverable throughout the week.</p> 
        <p>Monday to Friday are my core days where I will be spending at least 8-10 hours per day on the tasks.  Saturday and Sunday will need to be more flexible but I aim to spend at least an hour each of those days working.</p>
        <p>Realizing that I have a desire to learn things thoroughly I need to listen to the advice of the facilitators. I need to focus on keeping things simple and nailing the learning competencies. I will set my 8 hours each workday to sticking to the timeboxing provided. When I feel during this that I need to investigate something further I will allow myself a set amount of time (say and hour or a half an hour) to explore. This time will be additional to my core time and will result in an eight and a half or nine hour day.</p>
        <p>Once the weekly tasks are met I'll move forward on to the next task and then the next etc.  Any time that is left at the end of the foundations will be spent exploring and learning more deeply.</p>
        
        <h3>Help!</h3>
        <p>Asking for help is something that I can struggle with. I like to solve my own problems and don't like to burden others with them. I've gotten better at this over time but it's still a challenge. My main focus here is in keeping a connection and open communicaiton with the facilitators. I also want to draw on the expertise of the group to help solve some of the problems I have.</p>
        
        <h3>Blockout times</h3>
        <p>An hour in the morning to run or go do some exercise</p>
        <p>An hour each morning and an hour each evening to practice guitar</p>
        <p>At least an hour each day to connect with friends, family, and my partner. -It's amazing how spending all day coding and having little to no verbal communication turns me into an unstoppable chatterbox when I finally interact with another person face to face!</p>
        <p>Every second weekend my daughter is with me and I need to be flexible to work around her needs</p>
        <p>Sleeping!!  Twice already I've stayed up past 2am because I'm enjoying what I'm doing and having fun with it. But I need to make my sleep time non-negotiable because although I might feel like I'm getting a lot done in the moment, I pay for it the next morning. It is more productive to get a
