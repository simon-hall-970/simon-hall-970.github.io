                <h2>HTML, CSS, and Javascript</h2>

                <h3>HTML</h3>
                <p>The html (hypertext markup language) document contains the content and structural elements of a web page. These elements and other content are listed, nested, named, and categorized. This content could be made up of containers, text, images,
                    links, metadata and a host of other types of information. This is the foundational document.</p>
                <p>Without the html part of the web page there is no web page.</p>
                <p>If we compare this to a guitar the html would be the wood, strings, nut, bridge and other parts that make up the guitar. It is also the order and structure that the parts are put together in to form the guitar. Some of these elements of
                    the guitar make up sub groups of items such as strings and frets.</p>

                <h3>CSS</h3>
                <p>The css (cascading style sheet) takes the elements in the html document and applies style to them. It provides all the styling on how the web page looks. It sets the colour, style, font, placement, transitions etc.</p>
                <p>If we look back at our guitar analogy the css would be the shape of the body, the color, whether the fretboard is maple or rosewood etc.</p>

                <h3>Javascript</h3>
                <p>The javascript is the coding that allows the interactivity with the user. This will allow the webpage to react and display different information depending on input received by the user.</p>
                <p>If we look at our guitar this would be the user playing the guitar by fretting and strumming the strings. It would also include things like turning the tuning heads to change the tuning of the guitar.</p>

                <h2>Control flow and loops</h2>
                <p>Control flow is the order (flow) in which the code is excuted. In it's most basic form control flows from top to bottom. There are different parts of code that can influence flow. For example an "if" statement is like a switch. It checks
                    for a condition, if the condition is true it changes the path of the flow to include a code block. If the condition is false then it will ignore that particular code block and continue normally.</p>

                <p>Loops are another example of controlling flow. A loop will, as its name suggests, cause the code to loop over the same piece of code over and over. It's important when writing loops that we include conditions that will break the loop and
                    allow it the code to continue to execute. If we don't include those breaks then the code will be stuck in a loop forever and cause the browser to crash.</p>

                <h2>The DOM</h2>
                <p>The DOM, in reference to what we are doing is the html Document Object Model. This a representation of the html as a whole lot of objects that can be grabbed and manipulated by javascript or css. The objects are typically element object
                    but could be any kind of node.</p>

                <p>A node is any kind of object on a page. It could be the html object representing the whole page, an element of it, or even an attribute of the element. Using something like javascript we can access these various nodes as objects and manipulate
                    them in anyway we can think of so long as we know how to provide the correct instructions.</p>

                <h2>Dev tools</h2>
                <p>Each browser offers some developer tools. This is an excellent set of tools not just for debugging but for design. It allows the developer to access various parts of a web page and manipulate them while visually watching what the effect
                    is on the page.</p>

                <p>As well as exploring elements and styles on a webpage we can also access the console to help with the writing of valid code. We can also access the code in the sources tab and save our changes. This can be very helpful.</p>

                <p>The resources tab will also show us a whole lot of information about the requests, timing and other informaion about a website. We can also see the various storage values. There are a lot of in depth developer tools that we can use to
                    explore various aspects of our web apps.</p>
