        <h1>Core Skills</h1>

        <h3>Core Skills so far in Dev Academy</h3>
        <p>
            It has been quite interesting to research neuroplasticity, growth mindset, EQ and other core skills during this part of the Dev Academy course.
            These things are definite buzzwords in the workplace as HR teams try to look to build the right kind of culture in the workplace. It's important to understand these skills, at the very least, to be able to demostrate them to potential employees. More importantly is understanding how they can help us improve ourselves. 
            There is a danger however in thinking these are the panacea for all ills or ignoring other important factors in the equation.
        </p>

        <p>
            Growth mindset is not a new thing. It's a new term for an old attitude that we used to call a "can do" attitude. It's a great attitude and the beauty of science today is that we understand how this kind of positive attitude actually influeces our physiology through neuroplasticity.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a true thing and it stands to reason. When people believe they can learn they will learn better than people that believe they can't. Self belief is a powerful thing. However, it's important we don't overhype this. There are limits to human potential and there are individual limits to the unique potential of each human being that are different from those of others. There are people that no matter how much they believe will never run as fast as Usain Bolt or be called on to make the winning shot in game 7 of an NBA final.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are limits to our potential. This is a fact. Another fact however, is that when a person embraces empowering beliefs (including a growth mindset) they will achieve at the higher end of their potential.
        </p>
        <p>
            The key message is that self belief is vitally important to success in life. However, we need to be aware that not everyone is blessed with equal potential. Why? For the sake of compassion and understanding. Some people do not have the potential to live fully independant lives or hold down jobs that will allow them to earn enough to provide the necessities of life. This isn't a result of their self belief or lack of a fixed growth mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            We should all adopt a growth mindset. We have good scientific grounding for doing so. By embracing  a growth mindset we will be more likely to achieve our full potential. But we should also recognize that this is not a panacea. Not everyone is lucky enough to be able to achieve the same and it is not their fault. It is important to have compassion and empathy for those less fortunate.
        </p>
        <p>
            This brings us to EQ. Developing our EQ helps us understand ourselves and those around us. Two core componentns of EQ are compassion and empathy. Building strong interpersonal relationships and improving our ability to work and communicate with others will help us in our careers and in our lives. It also though is not a panacea. Yes EQ is important, but it is overhyped. The strongest indicators for success in life are IQ and concientousness. Concientousness is the ability to work hard, to sacrifice short term gratification for long term gain. Concientousness encompasses self discipline, as well as the recognition of how our actions impact those of others around us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Don't read this and get the wrong idea. Neuroplasticiy is real, having a growth mindset and self belief is vitally important to learning and success. EQ is also very important.  We should learn about these things and practice them as often as we can. There are many traits that contribute to success in life. We should pay attention to these things. If we know what kind of mindset behaviours, and traits are likely to help us and lead us to the life we want then half the battle is won.  We have a compass point that we can set and start to live by. We know that because of the plasticity of our brains we can rewire ourselves to make those behaviours, attitudes, and traits a part of who we are.  We can build the life we desire and achieve to our full potential in all aspects of life.
