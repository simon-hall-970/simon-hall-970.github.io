        <h1>Values and Identity</h1>
        <h2>My core values</h2>
        <p>The things I personally value most in life are: music; creativity; family; friends; curiosity; honesty; kindness; integrity; fairness; learning; and truth.  I am optimistic by nature and tend to approach life with a generally positive outlook.  I am very curious and want to know the truth.  I have a degree in philosophy and appreciate creative and critical thinking.  I will sometimes play devils advocate just to challenge the accepted thinking of myself and those around me.  Which some of my friends and family love, but others sometimes find it hard to realize that just because I put forth an idea in the most robust way I can – doesn’t mean I agree with the idea.  I’m searching for truth wherever that may lead.</p>
        
        <h3>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h3>
        <p>While working as an administrator for a local gym my boss came in and told me that they were putting up the prices for the membership.  He said that we would need to send notice out to all the existing members to let them know that their weekly payment would be increased.  He wanted to give them two weeks notice.  Having read the contract thoroughly I pointed out that the contract says that the gym will give four weeks notice of any changes. My boss seemed annoyed that I pointed that out and decided we would go ahead with the two weeks and if anyone complained then we would deal with it on a case by case basis and give them the full four weeks notice. I felt this was very dishonest. The gym would not let people out of contracts easily and enforced every provision that was in their favour. For the owner to then want to think the parts of the contract that protected his customers were the only ones that could be broken it did not sit well. I discussed this with my colleague and told him that I was going to refuse to send any correspondence and to increse the payments for at least four weeks.  He said he understood my position but that he will do it, then I don't have to be part of it.  That put me in a very difficult position because now it was my colleague and friend that would be doing all the work while I did none. This was a difficult decision. In the end rather than have my colleague work late several nights in a row to complete the work I helped him. But it didn't sit right.  Ultimately I decided that not doing work out of principle wasn't worth the resultant burden on my colleague.  I wish I could have found another way.</p>
        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>One of my weaknesses is self-sacrifice. I believe this comes from the Catholic aspect of my culture.  I am not a religious person.  I consider myself an atheist. But I was raised by a Catholic mother, went to Sunday school, and Catholic schools throughout my childhood.  I was pretty young when I started wondering about some of the ideas but there was a long period where this stuff was taught as the truth.  There were some ideas that lingered long after.  The idea of self sacrifice is one.  While self sacrifice can be an ethical act, it can also be unethical.  The classic situation of the air masks dropping down in a plane is an example.  Trying to make sure everyone else has an air mask before putting one on yourself is causing more harm than good.  Sometimes to do the right thing by others we have to do the right thing by ourselves first.</p>
        <h2>Identity</h2>
        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h3>
        <p>My culture has provided me with a strong sense of family.  That family forms a place from which I can draw a lot of strength and support.  I was raised to appreciate the outdoors, healthy food, and sport.  This is a positive part of my culture that has helped me stay in good health and be mindful of my body. One of the core values from the western culture that I was raised in was the idea of personal freedom and responsibility.  One should have maximal freedom to make their own choices, so long as those choices are not causing harm to others.</p>
        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
        <p>My strengths are in my people skills.  My ability to work in a team and to communicate.  I am very good at defusing situations and winning over people that have been described by others as “challenging”.  I love to get into a problem and stick at it until it is resolved.</p>
        <p>In the “big 5” personality descriptors I score very high in openness.  This is about being open to new ideas and experiences.  It is strongly linked to creativity, innovation, and problem solving.  This is very true of who I am as a person.</h3>
        <p>I also score somewhat high in extrovertedness, which is where my people skills come in and somewhat high in agreeableness which is where the self sacrificing comes in.</p>
        <p>Professionally agreeableness has some positive aspects but also some negative ones.  It can lead me to saying “yes” to too much and taking on more than I can achieve in a timeframe.</p>
        <p>I score low in conscientiousness.  This is about discipline and delaying short term pleasure for long term gain.  People that score high in conscientiousness are often very practical hard workers.  They tend to have strong time management and organisation skills.  This is not really me.  I can get so lost in my thought sometimes that I forget and lose items of clothing.  I’ve been that way since I was a kid.</p>
        <h3>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h3>
        <p>I think my openness drives a desire to constantly learn.  I don’t want to learn for the sake of grades or gaining recognition or achievement.  I want to learn to learn new stuff.  That to me is the ultimate goal.  I am a pretty good judge of when my learning is going well and when it is not and I put a lot of faith in my own judgement.</p>
        <p>I think my openness might intersect with my learning obstacles in the sense that  I can often get led down rabbit holes where there is valuable learning to be had but it’s off the path of the core learning objectives.</p>
        <p>I need to make a conscious effort to be aware of when that is happening.  I need to then timebox and give myself a set amount of time to investigate or consider an alternative (simpler) option.</p>
        <h3>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</p>
        <p>In one contract project I worked on the VP was a very optimistic, anything is possible, kind of person.  He wanted to build a piece of software to sell to our clients and saw it as an opportunity to expand on our offering.  He was very much a big picture person and didn’t get too into the detail.</h3>
        <p>He lined up a developer to work on the build of this tool and asked me to project manage it.  It was supposed to be a six week job and was all internal.</p>
        <p>Six weeks turned into six months and then eight months.  The developer had worked indirectly with the VP before.  They scoped the work together and were told it would be a six week job.  They agreed on a price.</p>
        <p>After four weeks reports started coming in that the work was not going so well.  But that it would only be another couple of weeks.  Then all went silent and in the eighth week the developer turned up.</p>
        <p>He had no product, and very little progress.  There were all sorts of issues that he didn’t foresee and this was going to take him at least another eight weeks to complete.</p>
        <p>I was very frustrated but tried to stay positive.  I told him we would have to consider other options and that he needed to let me know if he had bitten off more than he could handle.  He was adamant he could do it but that it was going to take longer.</p>
        <p>I explored some other options. Most of them said that it would take them a couple of weeks just to get up to speed with where things were at and that they would then be able to scope a solution and provide a timeframe and cost.  Their advice was that if it was only eight weeks from finishing then they wouldn’t be able to get it done any faster and may take longer than that.</p>
        <p>Six months later the project was still unfinished, it was starting to impact on my own reputation, projects with other clients, and budget.</p>
        <p>I drew on my family and loved ones for support.  I could vent to them about my day and they would offer practical advice or just a listening ear.</p>
        <p>I think one of the things that I should have done differently was to pull the plug earlier and get in a different contractor. </p>
