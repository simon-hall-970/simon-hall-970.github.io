                <h2>Problem Solving</h2>

                <h3>So I had this problem...</h3>
                <p>
                    Problem solving in code is difficult at times. I have a method that I trust for solving problems but the code itself, or more accurately, my beginner level of understanding of the language, can compound the problem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For example while doing the katas I needed to write a function that would return a specific value. I approached the problem in my typical way which is this:
                </p>

                <h3>Understand the problem</h3>
                <p>
                    The first thing to do is to get to the root of the problem. What is it specifically that you're trying to achieve and why? There is no point working on a difficult problem that could be resolved by solving an earlier much simpler problem!
                </p>
                <p>
                    In my particular case the problem was an exercise that was written for me so understanding the problem was a matter of reading the instructions and paying attention to the test results after each successful prior solution.
                </p>

                <h3>Planning</h3>
                <p>
                    What are the ways this problem can be solved. I do this with a pen and try to think about the problem in a number of different ways and come up with either a really simple solution, or for bigger problems I will come up with many solutions that come at the problem from different angles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to write these solutions down and test them out with some initial planning. In coding problems this is what developers call psuedocode. It's writing in plain language what you want the code to do step by step.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For the problem that I was trying to solve I needed to write a function that took an array of numbers and returned an array with only even numbers. I planned this out that I would need to filter the array so that it only kept numbers that had no remainder when divided by two. This was simple enough.
                </p>

                <h3>Research</h3>
                <p>
                    If I'm confident of a solution I might skip this step but typically I like to research to see if someone has had the same problem and if someone has already solved it.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This can often provide rewards in a number of ways as well as risks. I could find someone that has already solved the problem in an elegant way. I could find someone that has tried the solution that I'm about to try and had problems with it that I don't foresee. Or it might yield no particularly useful information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The risks of research is that I don't always understand what I'm looking at in a solution. I can find a solution that appears to solve my particular problem. Then it can take me a bit of time researching the parts of the solution to see how and why it works only to find out that it won't actually work in my situation.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I limited my research for this problem to reference resources only. I didn't want to find someone else's solution, the point was to create my own. I still conducted research though but focused on learning about the different methods available to me in building my function.
                </p>

                <h3>Try something</h3>
                <p>
                    A big part of problem solving is to try something. Try a solution see if it works. If necessary use the results of your attempt to inform future attempts.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is a fun part of problem solving. It works best though if you've done a bit of planning and thinking first.
                </p>
                <p>
                    My solution made sense. The research said it would work. But it wasn't passing the test. This was frustrating. Very frustrating.
                </p>

                <h3>Review</h3>
                <p>
                    Taking what you've learned start the process again. Identify the problem, plan, research, try something...etc.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where I solved the problem. I looked back at the start.  What is the problem, what am I trying to do. I want to return an array...wait a minute! My function isn't returning anything!. I typed a line to return the resulting array from my function and SUCESSS!!!! (This is the most fun part of problem solving).
                </p>

                <h3>Take a Break!</h3>
                <p>
                    Sometimes spending too much time on a problem prevents us from seeing something that can be really obvious. Already there have been two occassions where I've been unsure how to solve a problem and after spending an hour or so on it will walk away and come at it fresh in the morning only to sovle it in five minutes. Taking time to let your brain restructure itself and consolidate your learning from the attempts you have already made to solve it can help you solve it. If it's a big enough problem you might even work away at it for years before coming up with a solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Which brings us to the final point...
                </p>
                <h3>
                    Stickability
                </h3>
                <p>Sticking at a problem until it is solved. Einstein didn't consider himself a genius or smarter than anyone else. He said he's just better at sticking at a problem longer. This is about adopting that growth mindset and knowing you can do it, you just haven't done it YET!!</p>
