        <h1>Neuroplasticity</h1>
        <p>
           Neurosplasticity is the ability of the brain to rewire itself in response to stimuli and behaviours. It is a fascinating field but the focus of this blog is to talk about it's relationship to learning. For a nice under ten minute video that does a great job of explaining many aspects of neuroplasticity check this video out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QIowKKCx-1s&feature=emb_logo
        </p>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity and learning</h3>
        <p>
            The relation between neuroplasticity and learning is an easy one to surmiseâ€”when we learn, we form new pathways in the brain.[1] Repetition of the learning reinforces the neural pathways and connections making them stronger. A strong neural pathway becomes a default pathway. If something triggers that strong pathway then the brain will be inclined to follow that pathway through. This is extremely helpful in life, but as we'll see later can have its downside.
        </p>

        <p>The brain is typically lazy and will rely on the strong neural pathways as much as possible which in turn makes them even stronger. To create new connections we need to be engaged and focused on the learning. Through deliberate focused effort we can create neural pathways. Repetition of that learning will reinforce those pathways.</p>

        <h3>Neuroplasticity is always on</h3>

        <p>
            Neuroplasticity is a description of the way the brain works. It isn't something we choose to engage in or not. Our brains are always either strengthening the existing pathways at the expense of others, creating new neural pathways and pruning others. This happens whether we want it to or not. Once those neural pathways are established and strong the brain will find them easier and easier to traverse each time fires them making them stronger still making them a part of the brains default mode of thinking.
        </p>
        <p>
            This affects the development of new habits as well as new ideas and skills. The downside of this is that without deliberate focus and attention the brain is likely to pick up some bad default states. The great news is that it is never too late!
        </p>
        <p>Thanks to neuroplasticity we can wire new default structures inot our brain to create the patterns of thought and behaviour that we would like to see in ourselves. This is no magic bullet though. It takes thoughtful effort focus and repetition to break those old destructive pathways and create new ones. So how exactly do we do that?</p>
        <h3>How to change to brain </h3>

        <p>
            There are a number of things to be aware of if you want to rewire your brain. Understanding these things will help you understand how to create the best chance of building a brain you want.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Brains will change most when in the right frame.</em> A frame is a state of mind. Engaging in different mind states will change the chemistry of your brain. You need to engage the focused attention and active learning state in order to make the most significant changes in your brain. To do this you should:
            <ul>
                <li>focus focusing on what you want to learn helps your brain recognize the importance of a new connection making it less likely to get pruned later. Focus on the things that are important in your environment. Give them your full attention. Practice doing this as consistently as possible. You could also think of this as mindfulness.</li>
                <li>be positive and open. By keeping a positive open mind you are priming your brain to accepting new experiences. When the brain is in a state of stress it becomes an emergency to the brain. Your brain will start to prune back anything not relevant to dealing with the immediate threat and will strengthen the pathways of the perceived threat. Many of those stress triggers in the modern world are with us constantly which can lead us to a constant state of stress and anxiety.</li>
                <li>practice mindfulness meditation. This is a great way to deal with stress. It also strenghtens the brain. Studies show that the practice of daily meditation can stop or reverse age related brain decline in certain areas of the brain. If that isn't enough reason to start meditating then spend a bit of time researching the benefits to the body as well.</li>
                <li>eat good food. This kind of goes without saying but we are biomechanical machines. Amazing machines that can rebuild themselves to suit their environment. Fuel your body with the right nutrients that it needs and it will be easier to perform at its optimum.</li>
                <li>exercise regularly. Running and other aerobic activity are great for stimulating brain growth as well as lowering stress and improving focus. The health benefits of regular exercise are well known and documented.</li>
                <li>sleep. Super important. I'm coming back to this because it is so important.</li>
                <li>have the right attitude! Seek novelty, push yourself out of your comfort zone, try new things and learn new skills. It's all about attitude.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h4>Sleep</h4>
        <p>Sleep is so important to the health of our brains and bodies. Its importance is often overlooked by people. As try to fit everything into their busy lives sleep is often the thing that is sacrificed. The body needs five full sleep cycles per night. Each sleep cycle is approximately 90 minutes. That's about 7.5 hours of sleep per night. Allow 8 for safe measure. Watch this powerful talk on the importance of sleep.
