        <h1>Emotional Intelligence</h1>

        <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence</h3>

        <p>Emotional intelligence is the measure of one's understanding of emotional experience and the resulting behaviours within ourselves as well as those of others.</p>

        <p>The key for most peope to unlocking emotional intelligence, is to first understand the emotional reactions and responses in ourselves and the way they influence our behavoiur. When we know what it is like to be angry, can recognize the physiological
            sensations that we experience when we are angry, notice the way that the emotional state influences our reasoning processes, and understand how all of that drives our behaviours and expressions then we can recognize what it is like for other
            people to experience anger. We can observe their behaviour and understand some of their motivations.</p>

        <h3>Emotions are body states</h3>

        <p>The mental states that we subjectively experience as emotion are changes in brain chemistry. Emotions are essentially biological processes. They are are a result of physiological reactions to perceived external stimuli. Throughout millions of
            years of evolution animals have survived through being able to change their physiological state to provide a survival and reproductive advantage depending on what they perceive in the world around them. If you percieve a threat, for example,
            your body will prime itself to fight or flee by releasing adrenaline. So, a key part in understanding our emotions is in recognizing the physiological statest in which they manifest themselves.</p>

        <h3>Mindfulness meditation</h3>
        <p>Medition and mindfulness take many forms and can be very powerful in improving our emotional intelligence. There are times when our meditation time should be spent reflecting on times we experienced strong emotions. We should try to understand
            what sensations were happening in our body leading up to the emotion, what sensations were happening in our body when we were experiencing the emotion, how did the emotion influence our ability to reason, the influence those emotions then
            had on our behaviours and actions. </p>

        <h3>EQ and IQ</h3>
        <p>IQ is the measure of a specific type of intelligence linked to pattern recognition, logical reasoning, and various other mental faculties that are generally well measured in a typical school setting. There are other aspects to a person's intelligence
            that are measured or deemed less important. These include among others, kinisthetic intelligence and emotional intelligence.</p>

        <h3>EQ and the relationship to success in life</h3>
        <p>Many articles argue that emotional success is important to success in life. Some questioning whether it is more important than or at least as important as IQ.</p>
        <p>The answer to this question is much less simple. For one thing. What exactly is "success in life"? If we are talking about one's ability to have a successful career and build wealth then emotional inteligence is certainly useful but not essential.
            There are many people throughout history that have had questionable emotional intelligence but been very successful. Donald Trump, Mark Zucherberg, and Steve Jobs are three examples. </p>
        <p>If instead we are measuring success in life by our relationships with other people then emotional intelligence is very important. But "success in life" is something that can differ in meaning from person to person.</p>
        <p>To further complicate matters we should also consider people with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder). A symptom of ASD is the ability to navigate social interactions and understand the emotional responsees and behavoiurs in other people. Yet it is
            still possible that despite not scoring high on measures of emotional intelligence they can still have meaningful relationships and a successful life.</p>
        <p>Emotional intelligence is important in working as part of a team. Someone that has a high emotional intelligence will build rapport quickly with their fellow team members. They will encourage positivity and help create a positive working environment.
            As such it is very much a trend in most professional environments today. But it is a stretch too far to say that emotional intelligence is a strong indicator of success in life.</p>
