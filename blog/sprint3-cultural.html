            <h1>EQ and IQ</h1>
        
        <h2>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
            <h3>To be able to walk in another person's shoes. </h3>
            
            <p>The cornerstone of emotional intelligences is empathy.
                 
            <p>The key to unlocking what it is like to walk in another person's shoes, is to first understand the emotional reactions and responses in ourselves and the way they influence our behavoiur.  When we know what it is like to be angry, can recognize the physiological sensations that we experience when we are angry, notice the way that the emotional state influences our reasoning processes, and understand how all of that drives our behaviours and expressions then we can recognize what it is like for other people to experience anger.  We can observe their behaviour and understand some of their motivations.</p>

            <p>Of course understanding another human being is more than just understanding their emotions. We need to understand that the human experience is deeply complex and incredibly nuanced. While the vast majority of people do in fact share the same physiological states and motivations we all have unique life experiences and lessons that we have learned. However, even though we may not have had the same experiences as another person we can use our imaginations to imagine what it is like to have had the same experiences as them.</p>
            
            <p>This seems much easier to do than it actually is. The trick that catches most people out is the ability to recall the right experiences of their own when they imagine themselves in the other persons shoes.</p>

            <h3>Emotions are body states</h3>
            <p>The mental states that we subjectively experience as emotion are changes in brain chemistry. Emotions are essentially biological processes. They are are a result of physiological reactions to perceived external stimuli. Throughout millions of years of evolution animals have survived through being able to change their physiological state to provide a survival and reproductive advantage depending on what they perceive in the world around them.  If you percieve a threat, for example, your body will prime itself to fight or flee by releasing adrenaline. So, a key part in understanding our emotions is in recognizing the physiological statest in which they manifest themselves.</p>

            <h3>Mindfulness meditation</h3>
            <p>Medition and mindfulness take many forms and can be very powerful in improving our emotional intelligence. There are times when our meditation time should be spent reflecting on times we experienced strong emotions.  We should try to understand what sensations were happening in our body leading up to the emotion, what sensations were happening in our body when we were experiencing the emotion, how did the emotion influence our ability to reason, the influence those emotions then had on our behaviours and actions. </p>

            <p>In addition we need to understand that the human condition is deeply complex and incredibly nuanced. It is rarely a case of "</p> 
                
            
            <p>But is that all there is to emotional intelligence?  Do we unintentionally tie it up with goodness or is goodness a property of emotional intelligence.</p>
            <p>I will explore two quesions: <ul class="bullet">
                                                                <li>is emotional intelligence important to success in life and </li>
                                                                <li>goodness is not a property of emotional intelligence.</li>
                                            </ul>  
            </p>
